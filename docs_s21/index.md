# Algorithms for Private Data Analysis

## Overview


This course studies the following question in this course: 

<em>How do we perform useful analysis on a data set that contains
sensitive information about individuals without compromising the
privacy of those individuals?</em>

To study this question, we will introduce **differential privacy**, a
framework of designing data analysis algorithms with strong,
meaningful, and mathematically provable privacy guarantees. We will
survey a set of algorithmic tools that allow us to privately perform a
wide range of statistical analyses and machine learning tasks. Of
course, privacy does not come for free, and we will also study some of
the fundamental limitations imposed by the requirement of differential
privacy. We will also cover some novel and surprising connections
between differential privacy and and machine learning, game theory,
and cryptography.

## Prerequisites
This is a theory-oriented course, intended for graduate students and
advanced undergraduates. The (informal) prerequisites are mathematical
maturity, ability to read and engage with original research, and
familiarity with probability and introductory algorithms. Prior
coursework in machine learning, algorithms, and probability will be
helpful.

## Textbooks
There is no need buy any textbook for this course. We will provide
lecture notes in this course. In addition, we will frequently use the
book [The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential
Privacy](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf) by
[Cynthia
Dwork](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/dwork/) and
[Aaron Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/) and [The Complexity
of Differential
Privacy](https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/files/privacytools/files/complexityprivacy_1.pdf)
by [Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/).




## Diversity Statement
It is our goal that students from all diverse backgrounds and
perspectives are well served by this course, that studentsâ€™ learning
needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity
that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength,
and benefit. Dimensions of diversity include race, age, national
origin, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, intellectual and
physical ability, sexual orientation, faith and non-faith
perspectives, socio-economic class, political ideology, education,
primary language, family status, military experience, cognitive style,
and communication style. We are intentional in our aim to present
materials and activities that are respectful of diversity, based on
these dimensions and any other visible and invisible differences not
captured in this list. Indeed, in this class you will learn to
approach technology design from an empathetic, human-centered
perspective that directly examines and challenges bias and
inequality. Your suggestions for ensuring that the class lives up to
these values are encouraged and welcomed. In addition, if at any time
you experience or witness anything in this class that challenges
inclusion, is insensitive or othering, or reinforces biases or
stereotypes, please report those experiences (responses can be
anonymous).


## Communication

- **Canvas**: We will be using Canvas for all assignments and grades.
Please also post all questions on Canvas as discussions instead of
sending emails.

-  **Email**: If you email your instructors, you might want to include the
  substring "DP Course" to begin a meaningful subject line and have
  tried to resolve the issue appropriately otherwise. For example, you
  should post questions about course material and homework assignments
  on Canvas first, and then use emails only after an appropriate
  amount of time has passed without a response. Please use your CMU
  email account.






## Grading


Percentage | Activity  | 
------|-----|
20%| In-class Activity Participation|
50%| Assignment 1-4, 12.5% each|
30%| Final Project|


## When Work is Due
- Projects and assignments are due on Sundays at 11:59pm. 


## Late Assignments
We realize that things happen, and that you might sometimes not be
able to turn in your assignments. To accommodate this, you will each
receive **5 free late days**.

Beyond those days, you receive a 5% penalty for each day late.  You
are welcome to budget late days as you like, for instance 3 free days
late for one assignment, 2 for another, or all 5 for one.

## Special Accommodations
If you have a disability and have an accommodation letter from the
Disability Resources office, we encourage you to discuss your
accommodations and needs with us as early in the semester as
possible. We will work with you to ensure that accommodations are
provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability
and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with
the Office of Disability Resources, we encourage you to contact them
at [access@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:access@andrew.cmu.edu).


## Health & Wellness
Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle
this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol,
getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you
achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are
many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of
the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for
support sooner rather than later is almost always helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult
life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly
encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services
(CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at
[http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/](http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/). Consider
reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help
getting connected to the support that can help.

If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night:
